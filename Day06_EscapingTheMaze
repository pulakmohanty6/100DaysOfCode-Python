# Today I learned how to define functions and use while loops, applying both concepts in Reeborg’s World.  
  I completed several challenges, finishing with the maze-solving task—here’s my solution to it.

def turn_right():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    
while not at_goal():
    if right_is_clear():
       turn_right()
       move()
    elif front_is_clear():
        move()
    else: 
        turn_left()
